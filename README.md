This project is intended to be a full-stack application similar to the popular "Leet Code" with extra bonus chat bot features to help with interview preparation. 

One of the most crucial aspects of preparing for technical interviews is data structures and algorithms. And with this preperation, the crux of it all 

is time complexity -- i.e. how fast your code runs asymptotically in big-O notation. Unfortunately Leet Code doesn't support the ability for a user to access the time complexity of 

their code, and so in my implementation of this project I used chat-GPT API calls to get as best of an answer as possible to support this feature among other things such as code 

improvization.
